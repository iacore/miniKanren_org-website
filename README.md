What is miniKanren?
miniKanren is an embedded Domain Specific Language for logic programming.

The core miniKanren language is very simple, with only three logical operators and one interface operator.
The core language, using Scheme as the host language, is described in this short, interactive tutorial.

miniKanren has been implemented in a growing number of host languages, including Scheme, Racket, Clojure,
Haskell, Python, JavaScript, Scala, Ruby, OCaml, and PHP, among many other languages.

miniKanren is designed to be easily modified and extended; extensions include Constraint Logic Programming,
probabilistic logic programming, nominal logic programming, and tabling.

A detailed discussion of the differences between miniKanren and Prolog can be found in the website itself.
